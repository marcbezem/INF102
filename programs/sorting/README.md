## 2 Sorting

A table of programs in this chapter, and which data files it takes as input (algs4-data refers to data files from algs4s web page):

| Program              | Data files    |
| :--------            |:-------------:|
| CompareSort          | *none, but takes two algorithms and two numbers as arguments* |
| JavaArraySort        | sorts every *word/number* it reads from standard input. You can therefore use '&lt;' and literally any text file. *algs4-data/&#42;Kints.txt* is a good place to start. |
| MySort               | *none* |
| SortCompare          | *same as CompareSort* |
