Short solutions to the problems of the INF102 exam on 22 February 2016.

1. Cubic solution: take ThreeSum.java on p. 173 of Algs4 and change "==0" to "<0".
O(N^2 log N) solution: minor change of

3. A hash table is a datastructure for fast search, insert and delete of unordered
keys or key-value pairs. Ideally these operations run in (amortized) constant time, 
independent of the size of the hash table. The idea is to use keys as array indices.
This is possible if the keys are small integers, for example between 0 and 99.
Ohterwise we use a so-called hash function which maps keys to array indices,
and we store the key in the table at the position indicated by the hash.
One problem is that the hash function is not injective, and cannot be so
as there are more possible keys than array positions. That is why we need
something called collision resolution, when two keys are mapped to the same hash.
The two main methods for collision resolution are separate chaining and linear probing.
In separate chaining each array element a[h] points to a linked list in which all
the keys in the hash table that have hash h. In linear probing collisions are
resolved by putting a colliding key on the first empty position to the right
in the table (starting again at a[0] if the search goes past the last position).
An important property of the hash function is that it spreads the keys well
over the index range. Implementation: methods get(), put() and del() in

4. Method dfs() in 
github.com/marcbezem/INF102/blob/master/programs/LinkedListDiG.java
marks all nodes reachable from a given node. Use as follows:

public boolean reachable(Integer s, Integer t){
    boolean[] marked = new boolean[V];
    dfs(s,marked);
    return marked[t];
}
