Short solutions to the problems of the INF102 exam on 28 December 2017.

1. * a) O(N^3), that is, cubical since there are three nested loops, and the inner loop
may have to be done each time if there is no triple with negative sum
   * b) Three possible solutions of increasing speed (and increasing number of points!)
     - O(N^2 log N): improve the cubical solution by first sorting and then replacing the 
inner loop by a suitable binary search (rank)
     - O(N log N): sort first and check whether the three largest sum up to a negative value
     - O(N): compute the three smallest and check whether they sum up to a negative value, reverse the order in:

   * c) The mathematical argument is a bit involved, and any correct intuition will already give many points. The probability that there are exact 3 negatives among the first n is binom(n,3) 2^-1. Three negatives is sufficient (but not neccessary) for a negative sum. The expected number of t-values we test on negativity is therefore less than n*binom(n,3)*2^-n = O(n^4 * 2^-n) = O(1). A simple count in the inner loop of the three nested loops suffices. Note that without this extra measure the O(1) average cannot be guaranteed since t[0] and t[1] can both be positive (which has probability 1/4).
