Short solutions to the problems of the INF102 exam on 6 December 2017. DRAFT!!!

1. * a: 
* b: Four solutions of increasing speed
- Cubical: replace `==` by `>` in `existsThreeSumZero()`
- O(N^2 log N): improve the cubical solution by first sorting and then replacing the 
inner loop by a suitable binary search (rank)
- O(N log N): sort first and check whether the three largest sum up to a positive value
- O(N): <http://github.com/marcbezem/INF102/blob/master/programs/oddsAndEnds/existsThreeSumPos.java>

2. * a: <http://github.com/marcbezem/INF102/blob/master/programs/sorting/quickSort/QuickSort.java>, O(N log N).
* b: O(N^2) behaviour occurs if the first pivot is the smallest argument, the second pivot the next smallests, and so on. This happens if the pivot is a[lo] and the array is already sorted.
* c: A random shuffle of the array before sorting makes the worst case highly unlikely
* d: A sorting algorithm is called stable if the order in which duplicate elements occur is the
same before and after sorting. The algorithms under a) and c) are in general not stable.

3. <http://github.com/marcbezem/INF102/blob/master/programs/searching/hashTable/LinearProbingHashST.java>

4. * a: An MST is a subgraph that is a tree (connected and N-1 edges if the graph has N nodes) with the sum of the weights of the edges minimal.
   * b: Kruskal's algorithm computes an MST by first sorting the edges on their weight, in increasing order. Then a Union-Find client is initialized with all the nodes of the graph. Thereafter N-1 edges are output (or put in a queue) by the following process:
      - take the lightest edge that has not yet been processed and call it e;
      - if the endpoints of e are not yet UF.connected, output e and UF.union its endpoints;
      - repeat until in total N-1 edges are output.
   * c: nodes 0,1,2,3, weighted edges (0,1,11),(0,2,12), (0,3,13), (1,2,14), (1,3,15), (2,3,16).
MST consists of the first three edges.

   There are many variations. Instead of sorting the edges a heap (MinPQ) can be used.
